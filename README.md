## Setup

1. This app requires a Hackclub AI API Key. If you already have one, copy it and
   jump to step 2. If not, continue reading. To get a key, visit
   [ai.hackclub.com](https://ai.hackclub.com). Sign in with hackclub, scroll
   down, and create a new key. Keep it safe because you will need it later.

2. Visit the main instance available at [ai.eli.best](https://ai.eli.best). From
   there, navigate to the bottom left corner of the page. Click the user
   section, and then click "Sign in with Hackclub". After that, click the user
   section once more, but this time navigating to "Set API Key". Paste in the
   API key you got from hack club.

## Usage

After you are done with this, you can create a new chat using the button
helpfully labeled "New Chat". If on mobile, this will appear as an icon with a
pencil. You can select a model from the top of the screen, and enable web search
or view context/usage from the bottom. Temperature and topP can be configured
from the `{ }` icon in the top bar (Model Parameters). Test out image generation
by using nano banana and asking for an image! Check your API key usage in the
user bubble or at `/usage`.
